		<div id="1" class="faq-q">
			<h4>How long do Glitter Tattoos last?</h4>
			<p>It is impossible to give an exact answer as glitter tattoos can last anywhere between 2 days and 2 weeks. It can depend on a number of variables, such as:
			<ul><li>location of tattoo, if clothes rub the tattoo, or it is an area of movement eg wrist, it will fade quicker</li>
				<li>skin condition</li></ul></p>
		</div>
		<div id="2" class="faq-q">
			<h4>Are Glitter Tattoos skin friendly?</h4>
			<p>The glue we supply is a prosthetic PVA glue designed for use on the skin. It has been FDA tested and approved. 
				<br>
				The glitter is a very fine (1/100th of a mm), plastic PVC grain. It is safe for use on skin, although like all tattoo glitter we recommend that it is not used on the face.
				<br>
				Our tattoo stencils have been used by ourselves for a number of years without any incident, although they do contain the same adhesive as sticking plasters, so if a child is 
				allergic to these then it is possible irritation could occur.
